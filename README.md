# Bulk Manager
A tool that allows you to export parts of the content tree into Excel and then after make changes, import those changes back into Sitecore.

This was a solution we created for the 2017 Sitecore Hackathon.  The team `We do it for the Cookies` consisted of Leo Bevelacqua, Rob Mcclanahan and Dylan Young.

This solution is in alpha, if you run into any issues please report them in the issues section.
